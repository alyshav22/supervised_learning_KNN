# supervised_learning_KNN

The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning algorithms. The intuition behind the KNN algorithm is simply. First, it calculates the distance of a new data point to all other training data points. Then it selects the K-nearest data points, where K can be any integer. Finally it assigns the data point to the class to which the majority of the K data points belong. The KNN example below uses MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset. The dataset consists of 10 continuous features for 19,020 observations and a label that is either 'g' for a gamma-ray event or an 'h' for a hadron event.
